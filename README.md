Project Start

This project aims to design software for automatically generating schedule plans, making it convenient for individuals to better organize their time. It is planned to incorporate advanced features, including machine learning, to create personalized plans.

Simultaneously, this project will serve as a case study for my software engineering practice. The entire software design will follow the principles outlined in the book "Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach." The estimated completion time for the project is three months.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the development of the project.
